BUGS file for `gcal'.

Here are all known bugs of `gcal'; some will be corrected in future:

   * By reason of setting the Gregorian Reformation period by a command
     line option, it is possible to corrupt the calendars likewise the
     fixed date feature logically (which works correctly now for the
     year in which the Gregorian Reformation have occured) if this
     option is not used with care.

   * Fixed dates (inclusive lists or ranges of days, or repeated dates)
     specified without a concrete year (the year YYYY is set to 0) or
     those which are referenced by a date variable and the date of this
     date variable is set by a DVAR=`MMWWWN' or DVAR=`*d|wN[WWW]'
     assignment, the date of these fixed dates isn't computed correctly
     in most cases in that part of fiscal years or 3-month modes, after
     the year has changed.

   * Too many cryptic options and modifiers.
