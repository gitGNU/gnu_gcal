  This file documents Gcal, a program for printing calendars.  Gcal
displays a calendar for a month or a year, eternal holiday lists and
fixed date lists, in many ways.  The program correctly omits the dates
that were skipped when the current Gregorian calendar replaced the
earlier Julian calendar.
