readme.arm file for `gcal'.


To build `gcal' for Acorn machines, first create the
directories:  c  h  o
because Acorn's RISC-OS don't respect any file suffixes.

Then rename:  *.c files to *_c files
              *.h files to *_h files
and move/copy them to the according c or h directories.

Edit and run makefile.gcc after these steps.
