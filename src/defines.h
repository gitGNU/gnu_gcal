/*
*  To adapt this program, EITHER define/activate the following symbols in
*    this file OR add the following symbols in Makefile (-D`symbol=value'...)
*    (this all isn't necessary if the GNU Autoconf(igure) technology is used):
*
*  a)  - Define `USE_EASC 1' for using an extended ASCII character set.
*      - Delete the symbol USE_EASC or write `USE_EASC 0' for using the
*          ISO-ASCII/EBCDIC character set...
*
*  b)  - Define `USE_DE 1' for using German messages and calendar style.
*      - Delete the symbol USE_DE or write `USE_DE 0' for using
*          English messages and calendar style...
*
*  c)  - Define `USE_HLS 1' to run this program using control sequences
*          for highlighting the current day/holidays/text (MS/PC-DOS will
*          use the [n]ansi.sys driver for emitting ANSI Escape highlighting
*          sequences; OS2/Linux/UN*X-like systems will use `termcap' for
*          emitting the terminal specific highlighting sequences.  If this
*          fails, default (generic) ANSI highlighting sequences will be used).
*      - Delete the symbol USE_HLS or write `USE_HLS 0' to run this program
*          without highlighting...
*
*  d)  - Define `USE_PAGER 1' for using an external pager (availabe only
*          on UN*X-like systems) or for using the simple, internal pager
*          (if external pager fails).
*      - Delete the symbol USE_PAGER or write `USE_PAGER 0' if you don't
*          like this feature...
*
*  e)  - Define `USE_RC 1' for using the special month dates functions
*          (print daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/eternal/special fixed dates
*          texts which are stated in the resource file(s)).
*      - Delete the symbol USE_RC or write `USE_RC 0' if you don't
*          like this feature...
