ATTENTION file for `gcal'.

The `%s[DATE]' ("starting date" of event) and `%e[DATE]' ("ending date"
of event) special texts respected by former versions of the Gcal
program in the text part of a resource file line do not exist in this
style anymore in Gcal-2.20 or newer.  Using above mentioned old-style
special texts will not produce the wanted results if you use this
version of the Gcal program.

Use `%i[STARTING_DATE][#[ENDING_DATE]]' instead!

You can find an `old2v220' AWK respectively Perl script in the
`data/scripts' directory which converts old-style resource files into
the style used by Gcal-2.20 or newer.  This script will be used
automatically while running the `install' target of the `data/Makefile'
in case the enclosed appointment respecitively reminder files (likewise
the `~/.gcalrc' file) of the distribution are already installed.  In
case the `~/.gcalrc' file is processed in this above mentioned way, a
copy of its old contents by the name `~/.gcalrc~' will be created, too.

**** WARNING ****
The `old2v220' script is unable to manage `%s[DATE]' and `%e[DATE]'
special texts correctly if all or parts of the DATE component is/are
assembled by using Gcal's text variable mechanism!
