TODO file for `gcal'.

Planned features:

   * Support more country specific holidays (high priority).

     Well, if you think that I forgot to provide `gcal' with the
     specific holidays of your country, please feel free to send me a
     complete list of all the holidays which are celebrated there, so
     I'm able to include them in a next release.

     Such a list should ideally include the following informations:

        - The English name of the holiday.

        - The rule how it is built (like 10th October each year, or 47
          days after Easter Sunday's date, or three Fridays before the
          last Saturday in June...).  If there are any exceptions from
          such a general rule, please state them in a detailed manner.

        - Whether it's a "legal holiday" in all parts of your country.
          (Use a '+' character for marking this case.) In this sense, a
          legal holiday means a day people don't have to work -- as in
          most companies and businesses are closed, like
          `New Year's Day' on January 1st.  `Boxing Day' on December
          26th and `Easter Sunday' (I guess) and other important
          Christian holidays are likewise legal holidays.

        - Whether it's a legal holiday in some parts of your country
          only.  Please tell me whether such a holiday is valid in
          major parts of your country or not, try to express that using
          percent points.  (If such a holiday is celebrated in more
          than 70% of your country, use a '#' character for marking
          this case, otherwise use a '*' character.)

        - Whether it's a day only used for memorial or remembering
          purposes.  (Use a '-' character for marking this case.) Like
          `All Fool's Day' on April 1st is not a holiday in the sense
          that anyone has a day off from school or work -- just a *play
          jokes* day -- pretty ordinary.  Other holidays may be
          celebrated with cards etc. -- but they are still work days
          such as:

               Valentine's day, Father's day, Mother's day.

   * Support more country specific date formats which are burned-in
     into the program itself and are selectable during program start-up
     (medium priority).  I would like to hear your suggestions!

   * Support more Gregorian Reformation periods which are burned-in
     into the program itself and are selectable during program start-up
     (medium priority).  I would like to hear your suggestions!

   * Create more wrapper scripts which produce diverse sheets using
     Postscript/[La]TeX for adding to a personal *agenda* (medium
     priority).  I'm waiting for your solutions!

   * Support systems with Terminfo and without Termcap (low priority).

Nothing else to do actually, do *you* see anything missing?

By the way...

     I'm looking for volunteers who create a graphical front end to the
     `gcal' back end.  If you are interested in working out such a
     front end (native X11 and/or Tcl/Tk, Motif, DOZE-Win [NT], OS/2 PM,
     Apple...), please contact me!

     Some extended ideas could be part of such a user surface, like
     formatting of output for different printers, output converted to
     Postscript/[La]TeX, time management of fixed dates...
