README file for miscellaneous targets.

   * The simple sed script `gcalltx.sed' converts `gcal -n -u %0001
     year' output to LaTeX tabular output for `gcal'.  Any but default
     configuration might confuse this script.  It comes along with a
     UN*X script `gcalltx' and a DOS batch `gcalltx.bat' which supports
     the correct usage.  The program has been tested with the German,
     English and French catalogs of `gcal' under IBM/AIX, SUN/Solaris
     and MSDOS.  It should accept all country codes `gcal' uses.

   * The simple sed script `wdays.sed' converts `gcal %mon -Cdl7+
     -H::: ...' output so only all working days of the complete
     week, except holidays, and the succeeding Monday are displayed for
     the Anglo-American version of `gcal'.  It comes along with a UN*X
     script `wdays' and a MS-DOS batch `wdays.bat' which supports the
     correct usage.

   * The directory contains a file `magic.add'.  This is intended to be
     added to your `/etc/magic' file.  After adding this the `file'
     command will recognize GNU message catalog files (`.mo' files).

   * The locale name alias scheme implemented here is in a similar form
     implemented in the X Windows Systems.  Especially the alias data
     base file can be shared.  Normally this file is found at something
     like `/usr/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias'.
